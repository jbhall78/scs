SCS - Space Combat Simulator
============================

Notice
------
⚠️  This game is experiencing bitrot, which is a degradation of digital data over time. Some of the libraries it uses are deprecated, which means that they are no longer supported by the software vendor. As a result, these libraries must be manually installed, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. I am working on reducing the number of outside dependencies this software requires, which will make it easier to maintain and update.
